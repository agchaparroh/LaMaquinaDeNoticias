MANDATORY: Consult Context7 documentation BEFORE beginning any work on this task. Review module_scraper.md to ensure alignment with project objectives.

1. Create a basic CLI interface for spider execution:
   - Implement commands for running individual spiders
   - Support passing parameters to spiders
   - Add basic logging of execution results
2. Implement simple job status tracking for individual runs
3. Add error handling for failed spider executions
4. Create documentation on how this CLI interface integrates with Prefect for more complex orchestration
5. Ensure the CLI provides clear output about execution status
6. Implement a simple way to view execution history of recent runs

# Test Strategy:
MANDATORY: Consult Context7 documentation BEFORE beginning any work on this task. Review module_scraper.md to ensure alignment with project objectives.

1. Unit test CLI command structure and parameter handling
2. Test error handling with deliberately failing spiders
3. Verify correct execution of individual spiders through the CLI
4. Test output formatting and readability
5. Integration test to ensure proper interaction with the scraping system
