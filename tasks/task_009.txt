# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Spidermon Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate Spidermon or an alternative monitoring solution for spider health and performance, ensuring compatibility with our Scrapy version.
# Details:
1. Verify compatibility of Spidermon (version 1.16.0) with our Scrapy version (2.8+)
2. If compatible:
   a. Install spidermon library
   b. Configure Spidermon in settings.py
   c. Create custom monitors for:
      - Item validation
      - Spider performance (items scraped, response times)
      - Error rate monitoring
   d. Implement alerting system using Spidermon's built-in actions
   e. Create custom actions for specific alerting needs (e.g., Slack notifications)
3. If incompatible:
   a. Implement alternative monitoring system using structured logging
   b. Set up custom metrics collection for:
      - Items scraped count and validation
      - Response times and error rates
      - Spider execution statistics
   c. Create a simple dashboard or reporting mechanism
   d. Implement basic alerting through custom notification handlers
4. Prioritize basic monitoring functionality that is compatible and maintainable
5. Document the chosen approach and any compatibility workarounds

# Test Strategy:
1. Test compatibility of Spidermon with our Scrapy version
2. For chosen solution (Spidermon or alternative):
   a. Unit test custom monitors/metrics collection
   b. Test alerting system with mock data
   c. Verify correct triggering of alerts
   d. Integration test with running spiders
3. Verify monitoring solution works consistently across development and production environments
4. Performance testing to ensure monitoring doesn't significantly impact spider performance
