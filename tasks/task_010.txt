# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Playwright Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: low
# Description: Integrate Playwright for JavaScript rendering when necessary.
# Details:
1. Install scrapy-playwright library (version 0.0.26)
2. Configure Playwright in settings.py
3. Create PlaywrightMiddleware:
   - Implement logic to determine when to use Playwright
   - Add method for rendering JavaScript-heavy pages
4. Modify base spider classes to support Playwright when needed
5. Implement resource optimization to minimize Playwright usage
6. Add error handling for Playwright-related issues

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test PlaywrightMiddleware
2. Test JavaScript rendering with sample pages
3. Verify correct integration with existing spiders
4. Performance test to ensure minimal impact on scraping speed
5. Test error handling with intentionally broken JavaScript
