# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Rate Limiting and Politeness Policies
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and implement rate limiting and politeness policies to respect target servers. MANDATORY: Consult Context7 BEFORE beginning any work on this task.
# Details:
MANDATORY: Consult Context7 documentation BEFORE beginning any work on this task. Review module_scraper.md to ensure alignment with project objectives.

MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Consult Context7 before starting implementation.

1. Review documentation in module_scraper.md to ensure alignment with project objectives
2. Implement AutoThrottle extension configuration
3. Create custom RateLimiting middleware:
   - Implement per-domain rate limiting
   - Add support for custom rate limits per spider
4. Enhance robots.txt compliance:
   - Strictly adhere to crawl-delay directives
   - Implement support for custom robots.txt parsers
5. Create RetryMiddleware with exponential backoff
6. Implement IP rotation support (if using proxy services)
7. Add configuration options in settings.py for fine-tuning rate limiting
8. Verify implementation aligns with guidelines in Context7 and module_scraper.md

# Test Strategy:
MANDATORY: Consult Context7 documentation BEFORE beginning any work on this task. Review module_scraper.md to ensure alignment with project objectives.

1. Confirm implementation follows guidelines in Context7 and module_scraper.md
2. Unit test RateLimiting middleware
3. Verify correct application of per-domain rate limits
4. Test robots.txt compliance with mock robots.txt files
5. Check RetryMiddleware behavior with forced errors
6. Integration test to ensure overall politeness of the scraper
7. Document any deviations from Context7 guidelines with justification
