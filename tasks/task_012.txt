# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Rate Limiting and Politeness Policies
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and implement rate limiting and politeness policies to respect target servers.
# Details:
1. Implement AutoThrottle extension configuration
2. Create custom RateLimiting middleware:
   - Implement per-domain rate limiting
   - Add support for custom rate limits per spider
3. Enhance robots.txt compliance:
   - Strictly adhere to crawl-delay directives
   - Implement support for custom robots.txt parsers
4. Create RetryMiddleware with exponential backoff
5. Implement IP rotation support (if using proxy services)
6. Add configuration options in settings.py for fine-tuning rate limiting

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test RateLimiting middleware
2. Verify correct application of per-domain rate limits
3. Test robots.txt compliance with mock robots.txt files
4. Check RetryMiddleware behavior with forced errors
5. Integration test to ensure overall politeness of the scraper
