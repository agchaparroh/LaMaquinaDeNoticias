# Task ID: 8
# Title: Integrate Portia Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Replace Portia integration with alternative approach for dynamic spider generation, as Portia was discontinued in 2018 and is not compatible with modern Scrapy. MANDATORY: Consult Context7 BEFORE beginning any work and verify module_scraper.md documentation to ensure alignment with project objectives.
# Details:
MANDATORY: Consult Context7 BEFORE beginning any work and verify module_scraper.md documentation to ensure alignment with project objectives.

Based on the critical update that Portia is discontinued, we'll implement one of these alternatives:

1. Implement Scrapely integration for automatic pattern extraction:
   - Set up Scrapely in the project dependencies
   - Create ScrapelySpiderLoader class for dynamic spider creation
   - Implement adapter for Scrapely output to ArticuloInItem format
   - Add configuration in settings.py for Scrapely integration

2. Implement JSON configuration for dynamic spiders:
   - Design JSON schema for spider configuration
   - Create JsonSpiderLoader class to generate spiders from config files
   - Implement validation for JSON spider configurations
   - Add directory structure for storing JSON spider configurations

3. Error handling for whichever approach is selected

All implementation decisions must be verified against Context7 and module_scraper.md to ensure they align with the project's architecture and objectives.

# Test Strategy:
MANDATORY: Consult Context7 BEFORE beginning any testing work and verify module_scraper.md documentation to ensure alignment with project objectives.

1. Unit test for the selected approach (ScrapelySpiderLoader or JsonSpiderLoader)
2. Test dynamic spider creation with sample configurations
3. Verify correct adaptation of extracted data to ArticuloInItem format
4. Integration test with actual dynamically generated spiders
5. Test error handling with malformed configurations
6. Performance testing to ensure dynamic spider generation doesn't impact system performance

# Subtasks:
## 8.1. Evaluate alternatives and select approach [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: MANDATORY: Consult Context7 BEFORE beginning this evaluation. Evaluate Scrapely vs JSON configuration approach and document decision with rationale. Verify alignment with module_scraper.md documentation.
### Details:


## 8.2. Update project dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: MANDATORY: Consult Context7 BEFORE beginning this task. Add required dependencies for the selected approach (Scrapely or other libraries needed) after verifying compatibility with existing project architecture in module_scraper.md.
### Details:


## 8.3. Implement dynamic spider loader [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: MANDATORY: Consult Context7 BEFORE beginning implementation. Create loader class for the selected approach that can generate spiders dynamically, ensuring alignment with module_scraper.md documentation.
### Details:


## 8.4. Create data adapter [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: MANDATORY: Consult Context7 BEFORE beginning implementation. Implement adapter to convert extracted data to ArticuloInItem format, following guidelines in module_scraper.md.
