# Task ID: 8
# Title: Integrate Portia Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Replace Portia integration with alternative approach for dynamic spider generation, as Portia was discontinued in 2018 and is not compatible with modern Scrapy.
# Details:
Based on the critical update that Portia is discontinued, we'll implement one of these alternatives:

1. Implement Scrapely integration for automatic pattern extraction:
   - Set up Scrapely in the project dependencies
   - Create ScrapelySpiderLoader class for dynamic spider creation
   - Implement adapter for Scrapely output to ArticuloInItem format
   - Add configuration in settings.py for Scrapely integration

2. Implement JSON configuration for dynamic spiders:
   - Design JSON schema for spider configuration
   - Create JsonSpiderLoader class to generate spiders from config files
   - Implement validation for JSON spider configurations
   - Add directory structure for storing JSON spider configurations

3. Error handling for whichever approach is selected

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test for the selected approach (ScrapelySpiderLoader or JsonSpiderLoader)
2. Test dynamic spider creation with sample configurations
3. Verify correct adaptation of extracted data to ArticuloInItem format
4. Integration test with actual dynamically generated spiders
5. Test error handling with malformed configurations
6. Performance testing to ensure dynamic spider generation doesn't impact system performance
