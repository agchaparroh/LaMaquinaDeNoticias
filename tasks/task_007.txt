# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Middleware for Request Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create and configure middleware for user-agent rotation, delays, and error handling, following project guidelines.
# Details:
IMPORTANT: MUST consult Context7 BEFORE beginning any work on this task.

1. Review documentation in module_scraper.md to ensure alignment with project objectives
2. Create RotateUserAgentMiddleware:
   - Implement a list of user agents
   - Add logic to rotate user agent for each request
3. Create DelayMiddleware:
   - Implement adaptive delays based on response times
   - Add randomization to delays
4. Create ErrorHandlingMiddleware:
   - Implement logic for retrying failed requests
   - Add logging for errors
5. Configure middleware in settings.py
6. Implement respect for robots.txt in middleware

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify implementation follows guidelines in Context7 and module_scraper.md
2. Unit test each middleware
3. Verify user agent rotation
4. Test delay logic with mock responses
5. Check error handling and retry logic
6. Integration test with sample spiders
