# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Middleware for Request Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create and configure middleware for user-agent rotation, delays, and error handling.
# Details:
1. Create RotateUserAgentMiddleware:
   - Implement a list of user agents
   - Add logic to rotate user agent for each request
2. Create DelayMiddleware:
   - Implement adaptive delays based on response times
   - Add randomization to delays
3. Create ErrorHandlingMiddleware:
   - Implement logic for retrying failed requests
   - Add logging for errors
4. Configure middleware in settings.py
5. Implement respect for robots.txt in middleware

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test each middleware
2. Verify user agent rotation
3. Test delay logic with mock responses
4. Check error handling and retry logic
5. Integration test with sample spiders
