# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Structure and Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the Scrapy-based scraping module within the existing project structure, ensuring proper integration with the current architecture.
# Details:
1. Work within the existing src/module_scraper directory
2. Use the already initialized Git repository
3. Create a virtual environment using Python 3.9+ if not already present
4. Install Scrapy 2.8.0 and other necessary dependencies
5. Set up the basic Scrapy project structure (spiders, items, pipelines, middlewares) within the module
6. Check for an existing Dockerfile and optimize it for Scrapy if needed
7. Ensure compatibility with the existing docker-compose.yml multi-module architecture
8. Update module-specific .gitignore patterns if needed
9. Initialize settings.py with basic configurations
10. Set up logging configuration in settings.py

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Scrapy structure is correctly integrated within the existing module
2. Ensure virtual environment is working
3. Test Docker build and run within the multi-module architecture
4. Verify Scrapy project can be started without errors

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Project Repository [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the project directory, initialize Git, and set up .gitignore
### Details:
Create a new directory for the project, initialize a Git repository within it, and configure a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from version control.

## 2. Set Up Python Environment [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create a virtual environment and install required dependencies
### Details:
Create a virtual environment using Python 3.9+, activate it, and install Scrapy 2.8.0 along with other necessary dependencies. Generate a requirements.txt file.

## 3. Configure Scrapy Project Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up the basic Scrapy project structure and configure settings within the existing module
### Details:
Use the 'scrapy startproject' command to create the basic project structure within the src/module_scraper directory. Set up spiders, items, pipelines, and middlewares directories. Initialize settings.py with basic configurations and set up logging.

## 6. Evaluate Existing Docker Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Check for existing Dockerfile and ensure it supports Scrapy requirements
### Details:
Examine the existing Dockerfile (if any) in the project and evaluate if it already supports Scrapy requirements. If needed, modify or create a Dockerfile that specifies the base Python image, installs Scrapy dependencies, and sets up the environment for running Scrapy spiders within the existing container architecture.

## 7. Integrate with Existing Docker Compose Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: 1.6
### Description: Ensure the Scrapy module integrates properly with the existing multi-module architecture
### Details:
Review the existing docker-compose.yml file to understand the multi-module architecture. Ensure the Scrapy module is properly integrated and can communicate with other services as needed. Make minimal necessary adjustments to maintain compatibility.

## 8. Update Module-Specific Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Configure Scrapy-specific settings within the existing module structure
### Details:
Update the Scrapy settings.py file with configurations specific to the project requirements. Ensure logging is properly configured to integrate with the existing project's logging system. Add any module-specific patterns to .gitignore if needed.
