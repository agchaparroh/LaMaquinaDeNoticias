## Review Process Overview

### Preparation Phase
1. **Proactive Context7 Research**: Before examining any code, use Context7 to thoroughly understand all external libraries and frameworks used in the module (Scrapy, Supabase-py, etc.). Document key insights and best practices for reference during review.

### Review Activities

1. **Module Structure Review**:
   - Evaluate overall architecture and organization
   - Check for proper separation of concerns
   - Verify logical grouping of functionality

2. **Code Review (Per File)**:
   - **Pre-review Context7 Check**: For each file, use Context7 to understand relevant best practices
   - **Clarity**: Readable code, meaningful variable names, appropriate comments
   - **Efficiency**: Algorithmic efficiency, resource usage, performance considerations
   - **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling, graceful failure modes
   - **Best Practices**: Adherence to Python/Scrapy conventions and patterns
   - **Security**: Identify potential security vulnerabilities (injection risks, etc.)
   - **Supabase Integration**: Verify correct implementation of Supabase operations

3. **Documentation Review**:
   - **READMEs**: Completeness, accuracy, and usefulness for new developers
   - **Inline Comments**: Presence and quality of docstrings and explanatory comments
   - **External Documentation**: Any additional documentation outside the codebase

4. **Configuration Review**:
   - Verify settings in `settings.py` for correctness
   - Check for security issues in configuration (exposed credentials, etc.)
   - Validate environment-specific configurations

5. **Dependency Management**:
   - Review `requirements.txt` for outdated or unnecessary packages
   - Check for potential version conflicts
   - Identify security vulnerabilities in dependencies

6. **Additional Research**:
   - Perform targeted online searches to clarify any doubts
   - Research optimal solutions for identified issues

### Documentation and Follow-up

1. **Findings Documentation**:
   - Create a comprehensive review report with all findings
   - Categorize issues by severity and type

2. **Sub-task Creation**:
   - Create specific, actionable sub-tasks for all required fixes
   - Prioritize sub-tasks based on severity and dependencies

# Test Strategy:
Manual review by developer, potentially pair review. Create a detailed checklist based on review activities to ensure thoroughness. Document findings in a structured review report and create specific sub-tasks in Taskmaster for all identified issues. Consider using static analysis tools to supplement manual review.
