      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of a comprehensive logging and debugging system for the scraper into detailed subtasks. Include configuration of different log levels, custom formatters, handlers for various outputs (console, file, external services), integration with existing components, error tracking, and visualization/analysis tools. Consider both development and production environments.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires designing a comprehensive logging architecture that works across multiple components. It needs to handle different log levels, formats, and destinations while integrating with the existing Scrapy framework. The complexity comes from ensuring consistent logging across all spiders, middleware, and pipelines while providing useful debugging information without impacting performance."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of rate limiting and politeness policies into detailed subtasks. Include domain-specific rate limiting, adaptive throttling based on server responses, randomized delays, respect for robots.txt, handling of retry scenarios, and monitoring/reporting of request patterns. Consider both technical implementation and ethical considerations.",
      "reasoning": "This task is highly complex as it requires balancing effective data collection with ethical web scraping practices. It involves implementing domain-specific rate limiting, adaptive throttling, and sophisticated delay mechanisms. The high priority and dependency on middleware task (#4) indicates its critical nature. The explicit instruction to consult Context7 suggests additional complexity or constraints not fully detailed in the description."

Include user documentation, developer guides, API references, architecture diagrams, deployment instructions, troubleshooting guides, end-to-end testing scenarios, performance testing, security validation, and final quality assurance processes.",
      "reasoning": "This task has the highest complexity due to its comprehensive scope and dependencies on all other tasks. It requires creating thorough documentation covering all aspects of the system while conducting final testing to ensure everything works together correctly. The high number of dependencies (11 other tasks) indicates this is an integration point for the entire project, requiring deep understanding of all components."
