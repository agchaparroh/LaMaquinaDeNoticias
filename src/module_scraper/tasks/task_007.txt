# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 7.1. Install and configure Playwright [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install scrapy-playwright library (version 0.0.33) and configure it in settings.py with DOWNLOAD_HANDLERS, TWISTED_REACTOR, and browser navigation options
### Details:


## 7.2. Create PlaywrightMiddleware [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create placeholder middleware in middlewares/playwright_custom_middleware.py for JavaScript rendering
### Details:


## 7.3. Implement rendering logic in middleware [completed]

### Description: Complete the middleware implementation with logic to determine when JavaScript rendering is needed, especially for empty content detection
### Details:


## 7.4. Integrate with BaseArticleSpider [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate Playwright middleware with BaseArticleSpider to handle cases where initial content is empty and requires JavaScript rendering
### Details:


## 7.5. Implement error handling [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add robust error handling for Playwright-related issues including timeouts, rendering failures, and resource limitations
### Details:


## 7.5.1. Enhance error handling implementation [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Expand on the basic error handling already implemented in BaseArticleSpider.handle_error() and the middleware's infinite loop prevention to include more comprehensive handling of specific Playwright errors
### Details:


## 7.6. Create comprehensive tests [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Developed pragmatic tests for Playwright functionality with focus on real-world use cases. Created test_playwright_basic.py with practical tests, run_playwright_tests.py script, and clear documentation in README.md. Tests cover empty content detection, Playwright errors, retries, and fallbacks without unnecessary complexity. Ready for development and CI/CD environments.

## 7.7. Document Playwright integration [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Created comprehensive and practical documentation including: playwright_integration.md (main guide with examples and troubleshooting), playwright_quickref.md (quick reference cheat sheet), playwright_technical.md (advanced technical documentation), and README_playwright.md (index and navigation). Documentation covers basic usage, configuration, troubleshooting, advanced cases, and production deployment, organized by user level from beginner to advanced with practical focus and real examples.
### Details:


## 7.8. Review and optimize error handling system [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the implemented error handling system in production, gather metrics on its effectiveness, and optimize based on real-world performance data. This subtask can be executed independently once the system is in production and we have real metrics available.
