# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Middleware for Request Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create and configure middleware for user-agent rotation, delays, and error handling, following project guidelines.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Centralized User-Agent Rotation Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a dedicated middleware for user-agent rotation that centralizes this functionality instead of relying on BaseArticleSpider implementation.
### Details:
Create a new middleware class in middlewares.py that maintains a pool of diverse user-agents and rotates them for each request. Include desktop, mobile, and tablet user-agents. Implement a weighted selection mechanism to favor certain user-agent types based on the target site. Configure the middleware in settings.py with appropriate priority in the DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES setting.

## 2. Implement Domain-Specific Rate Limiting Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create middleware that enforces different rate limits for different domains to prevent detection and blocking.
### Details:
Develop a middleware that tracks requests per domain and enforces configurable rate limits. Use a dictionary or database to store domain-specific configurations. Implement delay mechanisms that vary by domain (e.g., 2-5 seconds for news sites, 5-10 for e-commerce). Add randomization to delays to appear more human-like. Include auto-adjustment of delays based on response status codes (slow down on 429 responses).

## 3. Implement Custom Retry Logic Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create middleware that handles request failures with intelligent retry mechanisms beyond Scrapy's default RetryMiddleware.
### Details:
Develop middleware that extends Scrapy's RetryMiddleware with advanced features: 1) Exponential backoff with jitter, 2) Different retry strategies based on error type (connection errors vs HTTP errors), 3) Custom handling for specific status codes (403, 429, 503), 4) Proxy rotation on specific failures, 5) User-agent rotation on authentication failures. Configure max retries per domain and implement logging of retry attempts.

## 4. Implement Dynamic Request Headers Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create middleware that dynamically generates appropriate headers for each request based on the target domain and context.
### Details:
Develop middleware that: 1) Maintains a database of common headers for different sites, 2) Generates realistic Referer headers based on site navigation paths, 3) Adds appropriate Accept, Accept-Language headers that match the selected user-agent, 4) Handles cookies properly, 5) Randomizes header order to avoid fingerprinting. Include configuration options in settings.py to enable/disable specific header features per spider.
