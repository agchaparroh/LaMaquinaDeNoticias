# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Scheduler and Job Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a simplified CLI interface for executing individual scraping jobs, leaving complex orchestration to Prefect.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Create CLI Interface for Spider Execution [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a command-line interface that allows users to execute individual spiders with customizable parameters.
### Details:
Implement a CLI using argparse or click library that accepts parameters such as spider name, output format, and runtime configurations. The CLI should provide clear help documentation and validate inputs before execution. Include options for verbosity levels and output destinations.

## 2. Implement Job Configuration Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create a system to manage and store job configurations, allowing users to save, load, and modify scraping job parameters.
### Details:
Design a configuration format (YAML or JSON) to store job parameters. Implement functions to read configurations from files, validate them against a schema, and apply them when executing spiders. Include support for environment-specific configurations and secret management.

## 3. Develop Status Reporting and Logging System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Create a comprehensive logging and status reporting system that tracks job execution and provides real-time feedback.
### Details:
Implement structured logging with different severity levels. Create status reporting that captures spider progress, item counts, errors, and performance metrics. Design a consistent output format that can be parsed by other tools. Include timestamps and job identifiers in all logs.

## 4. Integrate with Spidermon Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Connect the job management system with the existing Spidermon monitoring to enable automated validation and alerting.
### Details:
Extend the CLI to support Spidermon monitor execution after spider runs. Configure monitors to validate scraping results and performance metrics. Implement hooks to trigger alerts based on monitor results. Ensure monitoring results are included in job status reports.
