# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Target Media Sources [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research and analyze the structure of target media websites (La Nación, El País, and other major Spanish and Latin American sources) to understand their HTML structure, article patterns, and content organization.
### Details:
For each target media source: 1) Document the URL structure, 2) Identify article listing pages and sitemaps, 3) Analyze HTML structure of article pages, 4) Identify key elements (title, content, author, date, etc.), 5) Determine the appropriate spider type to use (BaseArticleSpider, BaseCrawlSpider, or BaseSitemapSpider).

## 2. Implement La Nación Spider [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a specialized spider for La Nación that inherits from the appropriate base spider class and implements all required extraction methods.
### Details:
1) Create a new spider class inheriting from the appropriate base class, 2) Implement parse_article method with proper selectors for title, content, date, author, etc., 3) Configure start_urls and allowed_domains, 4) Add any site-specific logic for navigation or extraction, 5) Implement error handling for missing fields.

## 3. Implement El País Spider [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a specialized spider for El País that inherits from the appropriate base spider class and implements all required extraction methods.
### Details:
1) Create a new spider class inheriting from the appropriate base class, 2) Implement parse_article method with proper selectors for title, content, date, author, etc., 3) Configure start_urls and allowed_domains, 4) Add any site-specific logic for navigation or extraction, 5) Implement error handling for missing fields.

## 4. Implement Additional Media Source Spiders [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create specialized spiders for 3-4 additional major Spanish and Latin American media sources identified in the analysis phase.
### Details:
For each additional media source: 1) Create a new spider class inheriting from the appropriate base class, 2) Implement parse_article method with proper selectors, 3) Configure start_urls and allowed_domains, 4) Add any site-specific logic, 5) Implement error handling. Focus on major sources like Clarín, El Mundo, ABC, etc.

## 5. Create Comprehensive Spider Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Document all implemented spiders with detailed information about their configuration, selectors, and any special handling required.
### Details:
For each implemented spider: 1) Document the media source details, 2) List all selectors used and their purpose, 3) Explain any special handling or edge cases, 4) Provide example output, 5) Include troubleshooting guidance, 6) Add usage examples.

## 6. Implement Spider Monitoring and Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Set up monitoring for all spiders to track their performance, success rates, and implement optimizations based on initial runs.
### Details:
1) Configure logging for all spiders to track extraction success/failure, 2) Implement metrics collection (articles processed, fields extracted, processing time), 3) Create a dashboard or reporting mechanism, 4) Analyze initial runs for bottlenecks or failures, 5) Optimize selectors and extraction logic based on findings, 6) Implement rate limiting and politeness settings appropriate for each media source.
