# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Rate Limiting and Politeness Policies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement basic rate limiting and politeness policies using Scrapy's built-in capabilities and robots.txt compliance to respect target servers. MANDATORY: Consult Context7 BEFORE beginning any work on this task.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure basic rate limiting with Scrapy AutoThrottle [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Scrapy's built-in AutoThrottle extension to automatically adjust request rates
### Details:
Enable the AutoThrottle extension in Scrapy settings. Configure appropriate values for AUTOTHROTTLE_START_DELAY, AUTOTHROTTLE_MAX_DELAY, and AUTOTHROTTLE_TARGET_CONCURRENCY. Document the chosen settings and their rationale. Test the configuration with a small sample of requests to verify proper throttling behavior.

## 2. Implement robots.txt compliance [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure Scrapy to respect robots.txt directives for each domain
### Details:
Enable Scrapy's built-in RobotsTxtMiddleware in the settings. Configure ROBOTSTXT_OBEY setting to True. Test the implementation by attempting to crawl both allowed and disallowed paths to verify compliance. Implement proper error handling for cases where robots.txt cannot be fetched or parsed.

## 3. Set up domain-specific delays and testing [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Configure custom delays for specific domains and test the rate limiting implementation
### Details:
Create a configuration file or dictionary to store domain-specific delay settings. Implement a mechanism to apply these custom delays using Scrapy's DOWNLOAD_DELAY setting or middleware. Develop a simple testing framework to verify that rate limits are being properly applied for different domains. Document the testing results and any adjustments made to the configuration.
