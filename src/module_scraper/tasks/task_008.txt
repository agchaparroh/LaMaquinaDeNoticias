# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Logging and Debugging System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure and optimize the standard Scrapy logging system for the scraper module, following best practices for development and production environments.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Scrapy logging levels and formats [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure the standard Scrapy logging system with appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) for development and production environments.
### Details:
Utilize Scrapy's built-in logging system by configuring LOG_LEVEL, LOG_FORMAT, and LOG_DATEFORMAT settings in settings.py. Create environment-specific configurations with sensible defaults (verbose for development, minimal for production). Document when each log level should be used across different scraper components. Ensure proper formatting of log messages for readability.

## 2. Set up log rotation and file output [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Configure Scrapy's logging system to output logs to files with proper rotation to prevent excessive disk usage.
### Details:
Set up LOG_FILE setting to direct output to files. Configure LOG_ENABLED and LOG_STDOUT appropriately. Implement log rotation using Scrapy's built-in capabilities or integrate with system tools like logrotate. Ensure logs are stored in appropriate directories with proper permissions. Create separate log files for different environments or spider types if needed.

## 3. Test logging configuration across components [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Verify that all Scrapy components (spiders, middleware, pipelines, extensions) are correctly using the configured logging system.
### Details:
Create test cases to verify log output at different levels. Ensure all custom components use Scrapy's logger instead of print statements. Test log output in both development and production configurations. Verify that sensitive information is not being logged. Document common logging patterns and examples for team reference.
