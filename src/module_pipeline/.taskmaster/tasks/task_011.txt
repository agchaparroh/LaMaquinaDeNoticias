# Task ID: 11
# Title: Set up logging configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure structured logging using loguru (already in requirements.txt) for pipeline-specific needs with focus on request traceability, LLM debugging, and performance monitoring, while drawing inspiration from the existing module_scraper/scraper_core/logging_config.py architecture.
# Details:
Implement a robust logging system for the pipeline that enables request traceability, supports different environments, and facilitates debugging:

1. Create src/utils/logging_config.py inspired by the architecture in module_scraper/scraper_core/logging_config.py but leveraging loguru's capabilities
2. Configure environment-specific settings:
   - DEBUG for development, INFO for staging, WARNING for production
   - Appropriate output formats and destinations per environment
3. Implement key pipeline logging features:
   - Request correlation with unique request_id for end-to-end traceability
   - Component and phase-specific logging contexts
   - Basic performance metrics tracking
4. Set up log rotation and retention with daily files and configurable retention periods
5. Create utility functions for common logging patterns:
   - Execution time tracking
   - Sensitive data sanitization
   - Error handling integration
6. Ensure compatibility with FastAPI/Uvicorn and async operations

# Test Strategy:
Test the logging system to verify it meets the key requirements:
1. Verify request traceability across pipeline components
2. Test environment-specific configurations (development, staging, production)
3. Confirm log rotation and retention functionality
4. Ensure sensitive data is properly sanitized
5. Verify compatibility with FastAPI and async functions
6. Test integration with error handling

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze existing logging_config.py [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review and analyze the existing logging_config.py in module_scraper to understand the current implementation and identify reusable components.
### Details:
Document the current logging structure, configuration parameters, handlers, formatters, and any environment variable integrations. Identify strengths and limitations of the current implementation for pipeline use cases.

# Logging System Analysis Results

## Current Structure Analysis
The existing logging_config.py in module_scraper implements a modular architecture through the LoggingConfig class with static methods for configuration. The system supports multiple environments (development, staging, production, test) with environment-specific settings.

## Configuration Features
- **Multiple format support**: detailed, simple, json, and production formats controlled via LOG_FORMAT_TYPE
- **Structured logging**: JSON formatting and custom format templates
- **Component-specific configuration**: Dedicated mapping for different logger components
- **Date-based log rotation**: Files organized as {component}_{date}.log
- **Environment variable controls**: LOG_LEVEL, LOG_FORMAT_TYPE, LOG_TO_FILE, LOG_FILE_ENCODING

## Reusable Components
- Environment-based logging level system
- Multiple format options with environment variable override capability
- Organized log directory structure
- Component-specific configuration framework
- Configurable encoding settings

## Required Adaptations for Pipeline Integration
- Remove Scrapy-specific dependencies
- Add pipeline phase-specific logging
- Adapt component configuration for pipeline modules
- Simplify configuration while maintaining flexibility

## 2. Implement basic logging setup with environment configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create a basic logging configuration using loguru that can be adjusted based on environment variables for different deployment scenarios.
### Details:
Create logging_config.py that configures loguru according to the environment:
- Set up environment-specific log levels (DEBUG for development, INFO for staging, WARNING for production)
- Configure appropriate output formats (console for development, structured files for production)
- Integrate with existing environment variables
- Ensure compatibility with FastAPI/Uvicorn
- Create a setup_logging() function that initializes the logging system

## 3. Develop pipeline-specific logging features with loguru [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Implement logging features specific to pipeline phases and components using loguru's context binding to enable better tracking and debugging of pipeline execution.
### Details:
Implement pipeline-specific logging features:
- Request correlation mechanism to track requests across all pipeline components
- Component and phase-specific logging contexts
- Basic metrics tracking (timing, success/failure)
- Support for LLM interaction logging
- Supabase operation logging
- Ensure each pipeline component has appropriate logging context

## 4. Configure log rotation and retention with loguru [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Implement log rotation and retention mechanisms using loguru's built-in capabilities to manage log file growth and storage requirements.
### Details:
Set up log file management:
- Configure daily log rotation using loguru's capabilities
- Implement environment-specific retention periods
- Organize logs by environment and component
- Ensure proper file permissions and encoding

## 5. Create utility functions for standardized logging with loguru [done]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Develop utility functions that provide standardized logging patterns using loguru's features for common scenarios across the pipeline.
### Details:
Create helper functions for common logging patterns:
- Execution time tracking for functions and operations
- Sensitive data sanitization to prevent logging API keys or personal information
- Error handling integration
- Context managers for phase logging
- Ensure compatibility with async operations

## 6. Test loguru-based logging system functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5
### Description: Create and execute tests to verify the loguru-based logging system works correctly across different scenarios and configurations.
### Details:
Test the logging system to verify key requirements:
- Request traceability across pipeline components
- Environment-specific configurations
- Log rotation and retention functionality
- Sensitive data sanitization
- Compatibility with FastAPI and async functions
- Integration with error handling
