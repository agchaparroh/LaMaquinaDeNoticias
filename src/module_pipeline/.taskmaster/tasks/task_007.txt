# Task ID: 7
# Title: Set up FastAPI application structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the main FastAPI application structure in src/main.py following the architectural patterns observed in module_connector.
# Details:
1. Create src/main.py following the structure observed in module_connector
2. Import FastAPI and necessary dependencies
3. Initialize FastAPI app with proper async/await patterns
4. Set up CORS middleware if required
5. Implement configuration handling by integrating with the centralized configuration from Task 3
6. Include robust error handling and logging setup
7. Implement the health check endpoint GET /health
8. Ensure the application structure is consistent with project patterns
9. Load environment variables and settings using the centralized configuration

# Test Strategy:
1. Run the FastAPI application and test the health check endpoint using a tool like curl or Postman
2. Verify that the application structure follows the patterns in module_connector
3. Test async/await functionality works correctly
4. Verify that the application correctly loads configuration from the centralized configuration system
