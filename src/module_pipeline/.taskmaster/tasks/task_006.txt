# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Pydantic models for persistence
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create Pydantic models for constructing JSONB payloads required by the existing Supabase RPCs.
# Details:
1. Create src/models/persistencia.py
2. Implement Pydantic models that represent the JSONB payload structures expected by the existing Supabase RPCs
3. Focus on creating models for insertar_articulo_completo() and insertar_fragmento_completo() RPCs
4. No need to map all database tables - just create the payload structures

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests to verify that the models can serialize and deserialize sample data correctly, matching the expected JSONB payload structure required by the Supabase RPCs.
