# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement prompt loader utility
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a utility for loading external prompt files in src/utils/prompt_loader.py following established project patterns for modularity, file handling, encoding, and error management.
# Details:
1. Create src/utils/prompt_loader.py following the modular patterns observed in other project modules
2. Implement a function to load prompt files from a specified directory, maintaining consistency with existing file handling patterns
3. Use the same encoding standards for reading files as established in the project
4. Implement error handling that follows project conventions for missing or unreadable prompt files
5. Add caching mechanism to avoid repeated disk reads
6. Ensure the module structure and API design aligns with other utility modules in the project
7. Create utility functions for prompt templating if required, following project patterns

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests with sample prompt files. Test caching behavior and error handling for missing files. Ensure tests follow the same patterns as other utility module tests in the project.
