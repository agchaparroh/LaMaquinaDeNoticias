# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement PayloadBuilder service
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a PayloadBuilder service to construct JSONB payloads for Supabase RPCs from pipeline results.
# Details:
Create src/services/payload_builder.py with PayloadBuilder class that takes pipeline results and constructs the exact JSONB structure expected by insertar_articulo_completo() and insertar_fragmento_completo() RPCs. Include methods for serializing hechos, entidades, citas, datos, and relaciones. Add proper error handling and validation.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests to verify correct payload construction for both article and fragment RPCs. Test serialization of different data types and proper reference handling between objects.
