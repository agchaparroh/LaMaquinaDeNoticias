# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Groq API integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the Groq API service integration in src/services/groq_service.py, using the centralized configuration for API keys and following the module_connector pattern.
# Details:
1. Create src/services/groq_service.py
2. Implement GroqService class using groq==0.26.0 SDK
3. Use the centralized configuration (Task 3) to load GROQ_API_KEY and other settings
4. Follow the module_connector pattern for HTTP/API integration
5. Implement methods for initializing the client with API key and model ID
6. Implement method for sending prompts and receiving responses
7. Add retry logic using tenacity with exponential backoff
8. Implement proper timeout handling following module_connector pattern
9. Implement error handling for timeouts, rate limits, and malformed responses
10. Use loguru for structured logging of API interactions

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests mocking the Groq API responses. Test error handling and retry logic with simulated failures. Ensure tests verify proper loading of configuration from the centralized config system.
